# docker/aio.Dockerfile — masqueradarr "all-in-one" image (iflip721/masqueradarr)
#
# A SELF-CONTAINED build that merges all three docker-compose services — app + mongod + config-init —
# into ONE container, so the whole app runs from a single `docker run` with one data volume and no
# external MongoDB:
#
#   docker run -d --name masqueradarr -p 3000:3000 -v masqueradarr-data:/data iflip721/masqueradarr:latest
#
# To publish on a different host port, change the LEFT side of -p, e.g. `-p 8080:3000` (the container
# always serves on 3000 internally; the compose stack's MASQUERADARR_PORT env var does not apply here).
#
# Unlike a layered build, this needs NO prerequisite image — build it directly:
#   docker build -f docker/aio.Dockerfile -t iflip721/masqueradarr:latest .
#
# !! The spa-build / server-build stages and the APP HALF of the runtime stage MIRROR
#    docker/app.Dockerfile. KEEP THE TWO IN SYNC whenever either changes. Both images share the
#    node:22-bookworm-slim glibc base (required by this image's copied-in mongod, which is glibc-only), so the
#    runtime BASE is not a divergence. The only intentional divergence left is the all-in-one delta: mongod +
#    gosu + the /data redirect + the supervisor entrypoint,
#    and no `USER node` line because the entrypoint starts as root to chown the data volume.
#
# All-in-one specifics:
#   - mongod 7.0 (server only) runs --auth, bound to 127.0.0.1 ONLY (never port-exposed).
#   - A bash supervisor (docker/aio-entrypoint.sh) runs config-init -> mongod -> ready-gate -> node
#     under tini, dropping both long-lived processes to the `node` uid (1000) via gosu.
#   - One /data volume holds the DB (/data/db), composed exports (/data/compose via a symlink from the
#     non-overridable /app/compose), the config (/data/config.json), and the embedded mongo creds.
#
# AVX NOTE: on amd64, mongod 7.0 requires a CPU with AVX (same constraint as the standard mongo:7.0.15
# image). On hosts without AVX, use the multi-container compose stack instead.

ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:22.11.0-bookworm-slim

# ---- mongod binary source: the official multi-arch mongo image (amd64 + arm64) ----
# MongoDB ships arm64 ONLY via its Ubuntu builds — the Debian apt repo is amd64-only (its bookworm
# InRelease advertises no arm64), which is why an apt install fails the arm64 build. The official
# `mongo` image is multi-arch and built from those Ubuntu (jammy) packages, so we copy mongod out of it
# per target arch. The jammy binary runs on the bookworm runtime below (glibc is forward-compatible and
# the openssl 3 ABI matches; libcurl4 added there satisfies its last dep — verified). Pinned to 7.0.15
# to match docker-compose.yml's MONGO = 7.0.15.

# /proxy/target/release/masq-proxy. cargo-chef splits the dependency compile into its own gha-cacheable

# a glibc build and won't run on musl. The dulo browser here is Debian's apt `chromium` (same as app.Dockerfile).
# mongod is copied (not apt-installed) because MongoDB's Debian repo has no arm64.
