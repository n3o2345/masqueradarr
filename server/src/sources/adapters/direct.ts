// `direct` — the generic passthrough adapter for IMPORTED playlists. It is the long-anticipated "common /
// direct-URL" source the SourceAdapter contract already describes (types.ts: isEntryUrl false, resolveStream
// identity, isAllowedUpstream allows any http(s) host — private IPs included, so LAN sources work). An
// imported .m3u line carries a real upstream stream URL,
// so there is nothing to resolve: the stored streamEntryUrl IS the master. Imported channels set
// origin:'direct' so proxyPath()/channelToExtinf route them through THIS adapter's proxy (/api/v1/direct/…),
// keeping the SSRF gate, upstream headers, and child-URL rewriting centralized — the raw upstream is never
// emitted.
//
// It is `synthetic`: a proxy-only pseudo-source with no catalog. It is NOT a syncable (Default) playlist —
// boot init skips its shell row and the manifest omits it (see seed.ts / routes/sources.ts). Its channels
// live under each import Playlist's own id (routes/import.ts), not under 'direct'. listChannels/normalize
// exist only to satisfy the contract and are inert.
