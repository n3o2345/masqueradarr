### [masqueradarr](https://thebinaryninja.github.io/masqueradarr/) : Guides : Explanations : Documentation

**masqueradarr** is a self-hosted IPTV aggregator. It pulls channel playlists (M3U) and guide
data (EPG/XMLTV) from a range of online IPTV services, normalizes them into one catalog, and
serves them back as a single, unified, standards-compliant playlist + guide — behind one trusted
identity that your media apps and IPTV clients can talk to.

It is the direct successor to **[TVApp2](https://github.com/TheBinaryNinja/tvapp2)**, which is now
**deprecated**. masqueradarr is not a fork or a patch — it is a ground-up re-architecture of the same
idea, carrying the project into the `*arr` self-hosted media family (Sonarr, Radarr, …) it's named for.

# Evolution — **masqueradarr**

### Where it started: **TVApp2**

TVApp2 was a single, self-contained Docker container whose job was simple and effective: on a
schedule, **scrape a handful of IPTV providers** (TheTvApp, TVPass, MoveOnJoy), **download and
regenerate flat `.m3u` and `.xml` files**, and serve them over a small web interface so that
Jellyfin, Plex, or Emby could ingest them. It was a Node.js app on an **Alpine Linux** base,
supervised by **s6-overlay**, configured almost entirely through **environment variables**, with
HDHomeRun emulation and HD/SD quality toggles. It did one thing well — keep static playlists fresh.

That model had ceilings. Streams were **static URLs** baked into files, so anything behind a login,
a device check, an expiring token, or a rotating mirror couldn't be served. There was **no database**,
**no real UI** beyond file links, **no per-user access control**, **no live observability** of who was
watching what, and **no transcoding** for clients that couldn't play the upstream format. Every new
provider meant bespoke scraping glued into the core.

### Where it's going: masqueradarr

masqueradarr keeps the original promise — *aggregate scattered IPTV sources into one playlist + guide* —
and rebuilds everything underneath it to lift those ceilings:

- **Static files → a live, resolve-on-demand engine.** Instead of writing dead URLs to disk,
  masqueradarr resolves each stream **at play time** through an HLS proxy. That's what makes
  **authenticated** and **rotating** sources possible — e.g. an in-app, server-streamed Chromium
  captures a real login session, and per-play signed URLs are minted on demand.
- **Flat config → MongoDB + a real management SPA.** State lives in MongoDB; the front end is a
  **Vue 3 single-page app** with full screens for Dashboard, Active Streams, History / Metrics,
  Playlists, EPG Sources, Channel Mapping, Users, and Settings.
- **Bespoke scrapers → a source-agnostic adapter framework.** Adding a provider is one adapter file
  plus one registry line; the generic core (sync, catalog, telemetry) never branches per source.
- **File server → an API + a live video proxy.** An in-app player and M3U / XMLTV export for external
  clients, with playback served by a **rebuilt, durable Rust proxy engine** (`masq-proxy`) that resolves
  each stream on demand — HLS today; the few remux-dependent paths (e.g. HDHomeRun TS→HLS) are still pending.
- **Env-var toggles → users, roles & per-user access.** Real authentication (scrypt), session vs.
  stream tokens, and per-user tokenized playlist access.
- **Blind scheduling → live observability.** WebSocket-pushed viewer/bandwidth/buffering telemetry,
  live system-performance stats, and MongoDB-backed application logs.

## Primary Architecture

masqueradarr is **two independently-built, independently-versioned npm packages** that the Docker
image stitches together — *not* a workspace, and they never import across the boundary:

- **`/` (root)** — the **Vue 3 + Vite SPA** (the management front end; `hls.js`, `vue-router`, `mitt`).
- **`server/`** — the **Express 4 + Mongoose 8 API** (ESM, TypeScript `strict`), which serves the
  built SPA, the `/api/*` REST surface, and four WebSockets
  (login-stream, stream-stats, logs-stream, system-stats).

At a high level, the SPA and IPTV clients talk to the Express **control plane**, which owns MongoDB and
drives a Rust **data-plane** sidecar (`masq-proxy`) for stream bytes:

<img src="docs/diagrams/architecture-overview.svg" alt="masqueradarr primary architecture: browser and IPTV clients talk to the Express control plane, which owns MongoDB and drives the Rust masq-proxy data plane out to upstream IPTV sources.">

Key subsystems:

- **Sources adapter framework** — a source-agnostic core (sync → normalize → dedupe → resolve) with
  ~17 per-provider adapters, plus proxy-only sources — **direct** (passes user-imported stream URLs
  straight through) and **hdhomerun** (imports a local tuner's channel lineup; playback is dormant
  pending remux support in the video engine) — that back bring-your-own playlists.
- **Channel model** — a pristine synced reference (`sourcechannels`) projected into an editable,
  UI-facing store (`playlistchannels`); user edits survive re-syncs.
- **EPG + scheduler** — multiple guide ingesters behind one shared sync path — **Gracenote**,
  **EPG-PW**, **Jesmann**, and user-supplied **Custom XMLTV** (file upload or re-fetchable remote URL,
  streamed so multi-GB national guides parse with bounded memory) — plus the self-built guides that
  **built-in** carry. All driven by a `croner`-backed runtime scheduler over a persisted
  `cronjobs` collection.
- **Composition + export** — composes Global, per-user, and custom `.m3u` playlists with matching
  XMLTV guide siblings for downstream clients.
- **Video proxy engine — live.** A **remux-free Rust data-plane sidecar** (`masq-proxy`) resolves each
  stream on demand and serves it over a durable HLS / raw-TS pipe (retry, mirror failover, read-ahead
  buffering). Node stays the control plane (auth, resolve, token gate, telemetry authority); Rust moves
  the bytes. See [Video Proxy Engine](#video-proxy-engine).
- **Backup & maintenance** — full-system gzip backup / restore, scheduled backups, and Mongo
  index-rebuild / workspace-reset maintenance actions.

### Migration status

The rename and re-architecture are effectively complete: the codebase, brand, runtime, and Docker
images are all **masqueradarr**. The compose stack pulls the standard app image
**`iflip721/masqueradarr`** (built from `docker/app.Dockerfile`); the all-in-one variant is built from
`docker/aio.Dockerfile`. If you're coming from TVApp2: there is **no in-place upgrade path** —
masqueradarr is a new application with a new data model (MongoDB instead of flat files), so stand it up
fresh and re-add your sources through the UI.

### Lineage & credits

masqueradarr is the successor to **[TVApp2](https://github.com/TheBinaryNinja/tvapp2)** by
[TheBinaryNinja](https://github.com/TheBinaryNinja), and inherits its core aggregation framework
(ported from the sibling project). TVApp2 remains available, archived, and deprecated —
all new development happens here.

# Features

**Aggregation & delivery**

- Pulls **M3U playlists** and **EPG / XMLTV** guide data from multiple IPTV providers and normalizes
  them into one catalog.
- **Resolve-on-demand catalog** — each stream is resolved at play time (no dead URLs on disk), which is
  what makes **authenticated**, **token-gated**, and **rotating-mirror** sources possible. The bytes are
  served by the **Rust video proxy engine** (see [Video Proxy Engine](#video-proxy-engine) below).
- **Delivery surfaces** — an in-app slide-out player and M3U / XMLTV export for external clients
  (TiviMate / VLC / Emby / Jellyfin / Plex).
- **Composition + export** — builds Global, per-user, and custom `.m3u` playlists, each with a matching
  XMLTV guide sibling advertised via `x-tvg-url`.

## Getting started

masqueradarr ships as Docker images. There are two deployment shapes.

### Option A — Compose stack (app + MongoDB)

1. Copy the env template and fill it in:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   At minimum set `MONGO_ROOT_USER` / `MONGO_ROOT_PASS`, your `DOMAIN`, and the host volume paths
   (`COMPOSE_PATH`, `BACKUPS_PATH`, `MONGO_DATA_PATH`) — each host dir must be writable by **uid 1000**
   (the container's `node` user). To publish on a host port other than `3000`, set `MASQUERADARR_PORT`
   (and update `DOMAIN` to match).

2. Bring it up:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` (or your `DOMAIN`; the host port reflects `MASQUERADARR_PORT`). The app
   **self-provisions** its `config.json` from the `.env` on every boot — there is no host config file to
   manage.

### Option B — All-in-one (single container)

A second image bundles **app + MongoDB + config bootstrap** into one container, so the whole stack runs
from a single `docker run` with no external database — ideal for a quick trial or a small home server. One
`/data` volume persists the database, exports, config, and credentials. It's published under the
**`iflip721/masqueradarr`** name (see **Migration status** above). *(On amd64, the bundled MongoDB 7.0
requires a CPU with AVX; on hosts without it, use the compose stack.)*

To publish on a different host port, change the left side of the `-p` mapping — e.g. `-p 8080:3000`
(the container always serves on `3000` internally; `MASQUERADARR_PORT` only applies to the compose stack).

## First run

On first launch there are **no users** — the app reports `needsSetup` and the SPA walks you through
creating the **first admin account**. After that:

1. **Add a playlist** — the Add Playlist modal offers every built-in source plus custom playlists
   (clone / file / URL / HDHomeRun).
2. For an **authenticated** source (dulo), capture a login session from **Settings** (a server-streamed
   Chromium signs you in; only tokens are stored). The server then **keeps the session alive on its own**,
   rotating the token ahead of each expiry — and it **auto-discovers dulo's current Supabase config at
   runtime**, so when dulo migrates its Supabase project (rotating the public URL + anon key) the session
   self-heals on its next refresh with no re-capture and nothing to configure. If you captured the session
   from your own browser (pair/paste), just **close that dulo tab — don't sign out**: signing out of
   dulo.tv revokes the very session you handed over.
3. **Sync now** to populate channels, then optionally add **EPG Sources** and link guide data on the
   **Channel Mapping** screen.
4. Create **Users** with per-user access lists — each gets a personal **tokenized `.m3u` + XMLTV guide
   URL** for their IPTV client.

### Configuration

All runtime settings live in **MongoDB** and are editable on the **Settings** screen (domain, DNS
nameservers, video configuration, backups, …). The `.env` only **bootstraps infrastructure on first
boot**:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MASQUERADARR_PORT` | Host port mapped to masqueradarr (default `3000`). |
| `MONGO_ROOT_USER` / `MONGO_ROOT_PASS` | MongoDB root credentials; also assemble the app's `mongoUri`. |
| `DOMAIN` | Public base URL written into composed playlist / guide links. |
| `DISPLAY_NAME` | App display name. |
| `TZ` | Container timezone (used by the scheduler). |
| `COMPOSE_PATH` | Host dir for composed `.m3u` + XMLTV exports (uid-1000 writable). |
| `BACKUPS_PATH` | Host dir for scheduled backups. |
| `MONGO_DATA_PATH` | Host dir for persistent MongoDB data. |
| `MONGO_HOST_PORT` | Host port mapped to mongod (default `27017`). |
| `MONGO_URI` / `MONGO_HOST` | Optional — point the app at an external / Atlas MongoDB instead of the compose `mongo` service. |
| `DNS_LOG_LEVEL` | Outbound-DNS trace verbosity (`1`–`3`); seeds the setting on first boot. |
| `MASQ_EDGE` | Optional (default off). `1` inverts the topology so the Rust proxy owns the public port and Node runs behind it on a loopback internal port — same public port, reversible. Enable for scale / high concurrency. See [Public edge mode](#public-edge-mode-masq_edge). |

> App-settings vars are seeded with `$setOnInsert` — they apply on the **first provision only**. Change
> them in the Settings UI afterward; a redeploy won't clobber UI changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This sample enviornment variable is also included in the release notes and the `main` branch repository: `.env.example` \
> Ensure you update `COMPOSE_PATH` `BACKUPS_PATH` `MONGO_DATA_PATH` with the appropriate folders for your system. \
> \
> For the best experience, create each folder path assigned to `COMPOSE_PATH` `BACKUPS_PATH` `MONGO_DATA_PATH` before composing the docker stack. 
> ```bash
> mkdir compose && chown -R 1000:1000 ./compose && chmod -R 777 ./compose
> mkdir backups && chown -R 1000:1000 ./backups && chmod -R 777 ./backups
> mkdir mongo && chown -R 999:999 ./mongo && chmod -R 777 ./mongo
> ```

### Development

The repo is **two independently-built npm packages** (not a workspace):

```bash
# Frontend (repo root) — Vite dev server on :5173, proxies /api → http://localhost:3000
npm install && npm run dev

# Backend (server/) — tsx watch on :3000 (needs a reachable MongoDB)
cd server && npm install && npm run dev
```

There is **no test runner and no linter** — correctness is verified by `npm run build` (type-check) in
each package and by running the app.

# Pluggable sources

- A **source-agnostic adapter framework**: adding a provider is one adapter file plus one registry line;
  the generic core (sync → normalize → dedupe → proxy) never branches per source.

## Custom playlists (bring your own)

- **Clone** — hand-pick channels from any synced source into a curated playlist; the channels are
  independent copies (so edits don't disturb the originals) but streams still route through the real adapter.
- **Import** — pull in any remote **M3U URL** (re-syncable), upload a static **`.m3u` file**, or expose a
  local **HDHomeRun** tuner (its channel lineup is imported; playback — the TS→HLS remux — is dormant
  pending remux support in the video engine).
- Every custom playlist rides the same per-user, token-gated **`.m3u` + XMLTV** export machinery as the
  built-in sources.

## Local Now playlist

- Local Now ([localnow.com](https://localnow.com)) is a US-based FAST (Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV) service that delivers a **market-specific** lineup of live channels — local broadcast stations, regional news, and national FAST networks — curated by geographic television market. Masqueradarr integrates it as a fully managed, re-syncable custom playlist type with a bundled EPG guide.

> [!NOTE] 
> **US-only.** Local Now is geo-gated to US IP addresses. Attempting to add a Local Now playlist from a non-US IP will return a clear error. No VPN workaround is built in; route the server through a US network to use this feature.

### _Local Now_ : City / Market Lookup

When adding a Local Now playlist you choose a **city/market** — the geographic unit Local Now uses to select a channel lineup. Masqueradarr exposes two ways to pick one:

| Method | How it works |
|--------|-------------|
| **City search** | Type at least 2 characters in the city field. A typeahead calls `GET /api/import/local/cities?q=` which queries Local Now's `City/Search` API and returns matching cities with their market identity. |
| **Auto-detect** | Click "Use my detected market." The server reads the geo-detected market from Local Now's own homepage response and pre-fills the closest market to the server's public IP. Falls back to New York City if the homepage carries no geo signal. |

### _Local Now_ : DMA and Market — what they are

Every choice resolves to two stored identifiers:

| Field | What it is | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **DMA** (`marketDma`) | A numeric [Designated Market Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market) code — the Nielsen/TV-industry identifier for a regional television market. | `501` (New York) |
| **Market** (`marketSlug`) | A comma-joined list of Local Now market slugs — a primary city slug plus any associated PBS station slugs for that market. | `nyNewYorkCity,pbs-wnet,pbs-wedh,pbs-wliw,pbs-wnjt` |

Both are stored on the playlist row and are used together as the query parameters for every upstream catalog/guide fetch. They are set once at creation and never modified afterward (to change market, delete the playlist and create a new one).

### _Local Now_ : What the Playlist Provides

When you add a Local Now playlist, Masqueradarr:

1. **Creates a custom playlist row** (`source: 'local'`, `endpoint: 'custom'`) with the market's DMA and slug stored directly on the playlist.
2. **Immediately syncs the market's channel lineup** from Local Now's combined catalog + guide endpoint. Channels appear in the playlist the moment creation completes.
3. **Prunes subscription-locked channels** — any channel with `subscription_access.unlocked === false` is excluded; only freely available content is imported.
4. **Deduplicates** the raw channel list by channel ID before writing.

### _Local Now_ : Channel fields

Each imported channel carries:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | The channel's display name from Local Now |
| Group | `Local News` for local broadcast stations (identified by W/K call signs, `My City` genre, `hyperlocal`/`epg-local-now` slugs), otherwise the first IAB genre tag, otherwise `Local` |
| Channel number | The broadcast channel number when provided by Local Now |
| Logo | The channel's logo URL from Local Now |
| Stream entry | An opaque `localnow://<id>?slug=<slug>` sentinel — streams are **resolved on demand** per play via Local Now's DSP backend, not stored as static URLs |

### _Local Now_ : What the EPG Source Provides

Each Local Now playlist automatically creates and owns a **playlist-bound EPG source** (visible in the EPG Sources screen, labeled `<Market> — Local Now`). Key properties:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Source | `local` |
| Binding | Playlist-bound (`playlistBinding: true`) — manual sync and schedule controls are hidden in the EPG Sources UI; the **playlist's hourly cronjob** drives all refreshes |
| Guide data | Inline `program[]` from the market's catalog fetch — no separate EPG call needed |
| Guide window | ~5 programs per channel per sync (continuous coverage maintained by the hourly schedule) |
| Program fields | Title, start/end times, description, content rating, season/episode numbers (parsed from Local Now's composite title format), IAB category |
| Channel linking | Channels are **self-linked** automatically at sync time — no manual Channel Mapping required. Each channel's `tvg_id` and `epg` fields are set to point at this EPG source on first sync, so the guide renders immediately |

The EPG source ID matches the playlist ID — they are a matched pair scoped to the same market. Deleting the playlist cascade-deletes the EPG source, all guide channels, all programs, and the hourly cronjob together.

### _Local Now_ : Adding Multiple Local Now Playlists (Different Markets)

You can add as many Local Now playlists as you want, **one per city/market**. Each is fully independent:

| Aspect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Playlist row** | A separate `playlists` document per market, with its own `id`, `marketDma`, `marketSlug`, and `marketLabel` |
| **Channel storage** | Each market's channels are stored under their own playlist ID — there is no sharing or collision between markets |
| **EPG source** | Each market gets its own `EpgSource` (id = playlist id), its own `epgchannels`, and its own `programs` collection scope |
| **Schedule** | Each market gets its own independent hourly `Cronjob` |
| **Naming** | Masqueradarr disambiguates playlist IDs automatically — if you add "New York" twice the second gets a numeric suffix (`newYork2`) |
| **Deletion** | Deleting one market's playlist removes only that market's channels, EPG, and schedule — the others are unaffected |

**Example:** adding New York (DMA 501) and Los Angeles (DMA 803) gives you two separate playlists (`newYork` and `losAngeles`), two separate EPG sources, and two independent hourly schedules. Each can be assigned to different users via the standard playlist access controls.

## Guide data (EPG)

- Ingests guide data from **Gracenote**, **EPG-PW**, **Jesmann** (guided picker), and any **Custom XMLTV**
  source — an uploaded file or a re-fetchable remote URL, streamed so multi-GB national guides parse with
  bounded memory — plus the self-built guides that **playlist-bound** carry.
- **Channel Mapping** links channels to guide data with composite match-scoring and many-to-one EPG
  linking; the link survives re-syncs.

**Management SPA** (Vue 3)

- Full screens for **Dashboard, Active Streams, History / Metrics, Playlists, EPG Sources, Channel
  Mapping, Users,** and **Settings**.
- An editable channel store where **user edits survive re-syncs**, and shared progress modals for the
  long-running sync / compose operations.

**Users & access control**

- **scrypt** authentication, **admin / user** roles, and **per-user access lists** (allowed playlists /
  custom playlists).
- A session-token vs. stream-token split, and per-user **tokenized M3U access** (token-free download,
  token-gated stream).

**Observability**

- WebSocket-pushed **viewer / bandwidth / buffering telemetry** — the Rust proxy measures the true byte
  edge and reports it over the telemetry seam, so **Active Streams** and **History / Metrics** show real,
  live sessions.
- Live **system-performance** push (CPU / memory) on the Dashboard.
- Persisted **view-session history** + per-user metrics, and **MongoDB-backed application logs** (13
  categories, 14-day TTL) with a live log drawer — including a dedicated **`proxy`** category fed by the
  Rust engine's full resolve→fetch→rewrite→serve lineage.

> **The video engine is a Rust proxy.** masqueradarr serves video through a **remux-free Rust data-plane
> sidecar** (replacing an older transcode engine) that resolves each stream on demand and rewrites its
> `.m3u8` manifests — see [Video Proxy Engine](#video-proxy-engine) for the full picture. The one part
> still pending is remux / transcode (e.g. HDHomeRun TS→HLS).

**Scheduling**

- A `croner`-backed runtime scheduler over a persisted `cronjobs` collection: playlist re-sync, EPG
  re-sync, M3U / XMLTV recompose, and scheduled backups.

**Backup & restore**

- One-click **full-system backup** — a gzipped snapshot of every collection, downloaded or written to a
  configured backup directory on a schedule.
- **Restore** from an uploaded backup or a saved file; the restore re-orchestrates the dependent
  subsystems (boot init, DNS, scheduler) in place.
- **Maintenance** actions from Settings: rebuild MongoDB indexes, or reset the workspace (wipe content,
  keep users / settings).

# Channel Adapter Architecture : _Pluggable sources_

All adapters implement the `SourceAdapter` contract (`server/src/sources/types.ts`) and are registered in `server/src/sources/registry.ts`. The generic core (`buildSource`) never branches per source — every per-source difference is encapsulated in the adapter object. Each adapter's `resolveStream`/`proxy` are **live** — the Rust data-plane engine calls them per stream through the resolve seam (see [Video Proxy Engine](#video-proxy-engine)).

<img src="docs/diagrams/adapter-taxonomy.svg" alt="Channel adapter taxonomy: every adapter registered in registry.ts, grouped by shape — synthetic, authenticated, and the four anonymous resolve strategies (scrape, API sentinel, macro-fill, identity).">

## Lifecycle: how a built-in source reaches the UI

<img src="docs/diagrams/source-lifecycle.svg" alt="Lifecycle of a built-in source: provision, sync, normalize into sourcechannels, project into playlistchannels, afterSync writes guide data, and the SPA reaches playback through the resolve seam.">

# Playlists

> **Scope:** the playlist data model — what a playlist *is*, the built-in vs. custom kinds, how guide
> data binds to it, and how per-user access is granted. The catalog (`playlistchannels`) and the export
> surface (`.m3u` + XMLTV guide sibling) meet here.

## How Playlists work

A **Playlist** is a row in the `playlists` collection — the *envelope* (name, hosted URL, endpoint mode,
schedule, state). Its **channels live separately** in `playlistchannels`, queried by the playlist's
`source` (or clone) id. A playlist row with no channels is a valid, paused shell.

- **Two channel stores back every playlist.** A sync writes a pristine, source-of-truth `sourcechannels`
  reference, then projects it into the editable, UI-facing `playlistchannels`. You edit the latter (rename,
  disable, channel #, EPG link) and your edits **survive a re-sync**: a sync `$set`s source-derived fields,
  `$setOnInsert`s the user-editable ones, and prunes channels that vanished upstream.
- **Hosted URL + endpoint mode.** A `global`-endpoint playlist is served through the one consolidated Global
  M3U endpoint; a `custom`-endpoint playlist is served at its own path. The `url` ("HOSTED AT") always
  prepends `settings.domain`, so changing the domain in **Settings cascades** to every playlist's URL.
- **State + schedule.** `state:false` pauses the endpoint (downstream clients get a 404). `interval` + `auto`
  drive the scheduler; a manual **Sync now** is always available.
- **Streaming is resolve-on-demand.** A channel's stream URL is *derived* (`/api/v1/<source>/<enc-entry>`),
  never stored — the Rust video proxy resolves the real upstream at play time. Every channel keeps its
  `origin` source, so a cloned or imported channel routes through the right adapter's resolver.

## What kinds of playlists are possible

| Kind | `source` tag | Created via | Channels |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(Default) source playlist** | `<dynamic>` | Add Playlist → **Built-In** (provisions a zero-channel shell; populates on first **Sync now**) | Synced from the adapter; `id === source` |
| **Clone** | `clone` | Add Playlist → **Clone** — hand-pick channels from any synced source | Independent COPIES in `playlistchannels`; `origin` = the provider source for routing |
| **URL import** | `url` | Add Playlist → **URL** — fetch a remote `.m3u` / `.m3u8` | Parsed from the upstream; re-syncable via the stored `remoteUrl` |
| **File upload** | `file` | Add Playlist → **File** — upload a static `.m3u` | Parsed once from the uploaded file |
| **HDHomeRun** | `hdhomerun` | Add Playlist → **HDHomeRun** — point at a LAN tuner (`deviceUrl`) | Discovered from the device (channel lineup); playback (TS→HLS remux) is dormant pending remux support in the video engine |

Built-in defaults are **Global-endpoint** by default; the custom kinds are **Custom-endpoint** and ride the
per-playlist export machinery (their own path + guide sibling). All the type tags (`clone`/`file`/`url`/
`hdhomerun`) and modes (`global`/`custom`) are stored **lowercase**.

## Failover groups (channel backups)

Any playlist's channels can be grouped into a **failover group**: one **parent** plus an ordered list of
**children** — silent backups for the same real-world channel, possibly from **different providers**.
Select the channels on the playlist detail screen → **Group** → pick the parent, drag the children into
priority order, save.

- **One line exported.** The composed M3U (and its guide) contains only the **parent**; children are
  hidden from every export surface but stay visible (badged `parent` / `child`) in the management UI.
- **EPG identity is inherited.** Children mirror the parent's `tvg_id` / `epg` link — set at group save and
  re-cascaded whenever the parent's EPG link changes (drawer, Mapping screen, bulk edits). Direct EPG edits
  on a child are rejected (`409 failover_child_epg_locked`); auto-match skips children.
- **Play-time failover (establish-time).** When the parent's stream fails to establish — resolve failure,
  transport failure after retries, or (opt-in) a definitive upstream error — the data plane walks the
  children **in order** via `attempt=1,2,…` resolves and serves the first one that answers, under the
  parent's URL and stream identity. The session then **sticks** to the winning child (the failover cursor
  never walks back to the dead parent mid-play); the pin resets a few idle minutes after playback stops.
- **Cross-provider safe.** A child's grant carries its own adapter's headers under its own policy key
  (`policySource`), so a dlhd parent backed by a pluto child never pollutes dlhd's other streams.
- **Observability.** Active Streams badges a failed-over stream with `failover → <child>`; the scheduled
  channel probe keeps probing hidden children, so a dead backup is visible before failover ever reaches it.
- **Self-healing.** Any prune/delete that removes a group's parent (or its last child) auto-disbands the
  group; disbanding is also available in the Group modal — children keep their inherited EPG link but
  re-enter the export. Children must stay **Active** to remain probe-covered and candidate-eligible
  (a `Disabled` child is skipped at failover; a `Disabled` parent hides the whole group from exports).

Knobs: `failoverEnabled` (default **on** — configuring a group is the real opt-in) and
`failoverOnDefiniteError` (default **off**) in the [proxyconfigs subsystem](#tuning-knobs--the-proxyconfigs-subsystem).
For DLHD on the external-player endpoint, compatible MPEG-TS feeds use the continuous distributor. A
segment, token, or mirror failure is re-resolved (then walked through configured backups) without closing the
client socket; fMP4/AES feeds retain standard HLS behavior and recover on their next playlist poll.

<img src="docs/diagrams/failover-groups.svg" alt="Failover groups end to end: the group modal writes three fields on each channel doc and cascades the parent's EPG identity; compose exports only the parent; at play time a failed ENTRY establish sends the Rust data plane through failover_walk, resolving each ordered Active child through Node's seam (200 grant, 502 try-the-next, 410 exhausted) until one answers, after which the stream's cursor sticks to the winning candidate.">

## Playlists + EPG Sources with Playlist Binding

Guide data reaches a playlist through **two distinct mechanisms** — keep them separate:

1. **Channel-level guide linking (the everyday case).** EPG attaches to a playlist through its *channels*,
   not the playlist row. Each channel carries a 2-factor **`(tvg_id, epg)`** link — set on the **Channel
   Mapping** screen (or self-linked by sources that ship their own EPG). At compose time the guide is built
   from exactly the channels that carry a link, so "which EPG sources feed this playlist" is simply
   *whichever sources its channels are mapped to* — many sources can contribute to one playlist's guide.
2. **Playlist-bound EPG sources (`playlistBinding`). **Built-in** carry their *own* inline guide.
   When you sync such a playlist, its `afterSync` hook writes the guide **and** upserts a matching EPG source
   row flagged **`playlistBinding: true`**, then self-links the playlist's channels to it. These rows are
   *owned by the playlist's sync* — the playlist drives their refresh cadence, so the EPG Sources screen
   hides their manual-sync + schedule controls. You never add or schedule them by hand.

## Assigning Playlist access to users

- Access is a **per-user allow-list**, split to mirror the endpoint modes: `allowedPlaylists`
  (Global-endpoint playlists) and `allowedCustomPlaylists` (Custom-endpoint playlists).
- You assign membership on the **Playlists screen** (per playlist — it was moved here off the Users screen),
  not by editing the user.
- **Admins ⇒ every playlist.** An admin account's allow-lists are *materialized* to hold every playlist id
  (a real invariant, not just a role bypass), and creating a new playlist auto-grants it to all admins — so
  an admin always sees the full catalog.
- Each user gets a personal, **tokenized** `.m3u` + XMLTV guide URL for their IPTV client: the **download is
  token-free**, but the **stream is token-gated** to that user's allowed playlists.

---

# EPG Sources

> **Scope:** the guide-data subsystem — what an EPG source *is*, the provider kinds, the one shared sync
> path, how playlist-bound self-EPG differs, and how guide data is woven into a playlist's `.m3u` at
> compose time. The XMLTV wire format itself is the sibling of the M3U export.

## How EPG Sources work

An **EPG source** is a row in `epgsources` registering one guide provider. A sync writes two collections:
**`epgchannels`** (one row per guide channel) and **`programs`** (the airings), both keyed by a composite
**`<epg>:<tvg_id>`** id so multiple sources never collide.

- **One shared sync path.** Every kind goes through `syncEpgSource.ts`, whether triggered by a manual
  **Sync now** or by a scheduler tick; it maintains the per-source `syncSuccessCount` / `syncFailCount` and
  `status`.
- **A sync is a per-source replace.** The source's old channels/programs are swapped for the fresh pull. The
  streaming-XMLTV path replaces up-front, so a mid-stream failure marks the source `error` and the next good
  sync heals it cleanly (the shared `epgchannels`/`programs` collections are scoped by `source`).
- **Reorder + run-stats.** The EPG Sources screen is drag-to-reorder (`order`); the guide-generation
  run-stats (`lastXmlAt`, `xmlGeneratedCount`, `xmlFailCount`) are credited during compose (below).

## What kinds of EPG Sources are possible

The `source` discriminator (stored lowercase):

| Kind | Added via | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **gracenote** | Add EPG Source → **Gracenote** | Provider/lineup grid; provenance fields (headend / lineup / postal / country / …) let the grid URL be rebuilt + re-synced |
| **epg-pw** | Add EPG Source → **EPG-PW** | epg.pw per-channel XML |
| **jesmann** | Add EPG Source → **Jesmann** (guided picker) | Large national XMLTV guides, **streamed** so multi-GB files parse with bounded memory |
| **xml file** | Add EPG Source → **Custom** (upload) | One-shot uploaded XMLTV document |
| **remote url** | Add EPG Source → **Custom** (URL) | Re-fetchable remote XMLTV URL (streamed, gzip-aware) |
| **playlist-bound** | *(automatic)* — the playlist's `afterSync` binding | **Playlist-bound** self-EPG (`playlistBinding:true`); not user-added |

## EPG Sources with a Playlist Binding + the syncing process

- **Standalone sources** (gracenote / epg-pw / jesmann / custom XMLTV) sync on demand or on a `cronjobs`
  schedule, independent of any playlist.
- **Playlist-bound sources** (built-in) have **no manual sync of their own.** They are written by the
  *playlist's* `afterSync` hook off the same listing that playlist sync already fetched, and the bound source
  row is re-asserted (`playlistBinding:true`) on every playlist sync. To refresh a bound guide you **sync its
  playlist** — the EPG Sources screen deliberately hides their sync/schedule controls because the playlist
  owns the cadence.
- Either way, the *binding between guide data and a playlist's channels* is the channel-level
  **`(tvg_id, epg)`** link — Channel Mapping for user-added sources, self-linked for channel-adapter built-in sources.

## How EPG Sources are ingested into playlists during a compose

Guide data only reaches a downstream client at **compose** time, and composition is **playlist-scoped**: a
guide is written as a **sibling of the M3U** by `composeGuide()`, which runs off the *same Active channel set*
`composeM3u()` just wrote (the Global union, or one Custom playlist) — so a guide can never drift from its M3U.

<img src="docs/diagrams/guide-composition.svg" alt="Guide composition: composeM3u hands its Active channel set to composeGuide, which selects (tvg_id, epg)-linked channels, emits the channel and programme elements, merges them into one tv document beside the .m3u, and credits each contributing source.">

Per composed surface:

1. **Select** — keep only **Active** channels that carry a 2-factor **`(tvg_id, epg)`** link; index them by
   the composite key `<epg>:<tvg_id>`.
2. **Channels** — resolve each key's `epgchannels` row (display-name / call-sign / channel-no) and emit one
   `<channel>`, **de-duped by the bare `tvg_id`** (first-wins — two sources can publish the same id and a
   player can't disambiguate anyway). A channel linked to an `epgchannels` row that isn't synced yet is
   skipped, never orphaned.
3. **Programmes** — pull the `programs` for those keys and emit `<programme>`s, **re-tagged to the bare
   `tvg_id`** so each airing matches its `<channel id>`.
4. **Merge + advertise** — the result merges programme data from **every EPG source the playlist's channels
   link to** into one `<tv>` document written next to the `.m3u`, advertised via **`x-tvg-url`**. The guide is
   **token-free** and **not per-user** (a superset of any one user's channels is harmless).
5. **Credit** — every contributing source gets `lastXmlAt` + `xmlGeneratedCount++` (or `xmlFailCount++` on
   failure).

# Video Proxy Engine

> **Scope:** how masqueradarr actually serves video — a **remux-free Rust data-plane sidecar** (replacing an
> older transcode engine) that resolves each stream on demand and pipes it durably to the player. This
> section covers the two-plane split, the internal seams, the request path, the durability features, the
> tunable config, and the opt-in public-edge topology.

## Two planes: Node control plane · Rust data plane

Video is split across **two processes** that ship in the same container:

- **Node — the control plane (the brains).** Everything stateful and provider-specific stays in TypeScript:
  per-source auth (dulo's Supabase session + device fingerprint), scraping (dlhd's rotating-mirror, 3-hop
  Referer-gated resolve), the SSRF allow-set, the stream-token gate, telemetry authority, and config storage.
- **Rust — the data plane (the muscle).** A small standalone binary, **`masq-proxy`** (the `proxy/` crate),
  does the byte work: fetch upstream, follow redirects, rewrite `.m3u8` manifests, and pipe segments — fast,
  multi-threaded, near-zero-copy. It is **driven per stream by a "grant"** from Node; it never re-derives
  provider logic.

Node spawns and supervises `masq-proxy` as a child process (auto-restart with backoff). A missing or crashed
sidecar is **non-fatal** — the app keeps managing playlists / EPG / channels / users and serving M3U / XMLTV
downloads; only live playback pauses until it's back.

## The internal seams (loopback, shared-secret)

Node and Rust talk over one private loopback channel — `POST /api/internal/*`, guarded by a shared
`x-masq-secret` (the SPA never calls it; only the Rust engine does). One contract, four jobs:

<img src="docs/diagrams/internal-seams.svg" alt="The internal seams: Rust calls Node over loopback POST /api/internal/* with a shared x-masq-secret for resolve, telemetry, log, and (edge mode only) authorize.">

- **resolve** (`/api/internal/resolve`) — Rust asks Node to resolve a stream; Node runs the adapter logic and
  returns a per-stream **grant** (`masterUrl`, `upstreamHeaders`, `allowHosts`, segment relabel, the resolved
  `proxyConfig`, …) that Rust replays for the whole stream.
- **telemetry** (`/api/internal/telemetry`) — Rust measures the true byte edge and reports batched
  viewer / byte / phase / close events; Node stays the telemetry authority (Active Streams WS,
  History / Metrics, persisted `ViewSession`).
- **log** (`/api/internal/log`) — Rust ships level-gated, request-tagged engine logs into the dedicated
  **`proxy`** log category — the same "View logs" drawer as everything else.
- **authorize** (`/api/internal/authorize`) — **edge mode only** (below): the per-request stream-token check
  when Rust owns the public socket.

The telemetry + log responses both **echo the current log level**, so changing verbosity on the Settings
screen reaches the sidecar within one flush — no restart.

## How a stream request flows

<img src="docs/diagrams/stream-request-flow.svg" alt="Stream request flow: streamGate authorizes, proxyRelay forwards to the sidecar, an ENTRY request resolves a grant, upstream is fetched, and manifests are rewritten while segments are relabelled and piped to the player.">

1. A player requests `/api/v1/…` (in-app) or `/api/ext/v1/…` (external clients; the mount the composed M3U
   always emits), carrying the per-user `?token=` and the `?pl=` playlist id.
2. The **stream-token gate** runs first: valid token? enabled? (for a non-admin) is this source in the user's
   allow-list? Denials are **plain text** so a media player surfaces them.
3. On allow, Node **relays** the request to the sidecar and adds the client identity it can see (IP, UA,
   username) plus the shared secret.
4. Inside Rust, the **first** request (ENTRY) resolves via the seam to get the grant + master URL; **child**
   requests (HOP — variant playlists, segments, keys) reuse the cached policy. Manifests are rewritten so
   every child URL routes back through the proxy with the token re-embedded; segments are relabelled and piped
   straight through.

## Durability + raw-TS

The Rust engine is built to keep a stream alive on flaky upstreams:

- **Retry** — transient upstream failures (transport errors + `502` / `503` / `504`) are retried with bounded
  backoff; definitive `4xx` / `5xx` are forwarded verbatim (unless `failoverOnDefiniteError` routes them into
  the failover walk below).
- **Mirror failover** — a dead resolved master forces a **fresh resolve**, driving dlhd to re-probe and
  rotate to a live mirror mid-stream.
- **Failover groups** — when a channel has configured backups and its stream still won't establish, the
  engine walks the ordered children (`attempt=1,2,…` against the resolve seam) and serves the first live
  one under the parent's identity, then sticks to it for the session. See
  [Failover groups](#failover-groups-channel-backups).
- **Stall detection** — an idle read timeout (`readTimeoutMs`) turns a silent upstream into a clean truncation
  instead of a hang.
- **Read-ahead buffer** — a bounded in-memory buffer (`bufferSizeKb`) smooths jitter and fixes the
  chunked / no-Content-Length byte undercount that used to fake client-side buffering.
- **Batched telemetry** — events are coalesced and posted off the hot path, so reporting never blocks bytes.
- **Raw MPEG-TS** — with `outputFormat: 'ts'` (and automatically for compatible DLHD streams), an
  external-mount stream is served as **one continuous `video/mp2t`** stream (segments concatenated, no remux)
  for players that prefer a flat TS pipe; fMP4 / AES sources auto-fall back to HLS.

## Tuning knobs — the `proxyconfigs` subsystem

The engine's knobs live in the `proxyconfigs` collection (the `videoconfig` successor), edited in the UI and
resolved by Node into each grant (**Rust never reads MongoDB**). Two tiers, doc-level fallback:

- **`_id: 'app'`** — the **(Default)** config applied to every playlist. Edited on **Settings → Advanced**.
- **`_id: 'app_<playlistId>'`** — a **(Custom)** per-playlist override that fully replaces the Default for that
  playlist. Edited in the **playlist drawer** (`ProxyConfigPanel.vue`, auto-saved).

| Knob | Status | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `headerOverrides` | live | extra upstream headers, merged over the adapter's (operator wins) |
| `connectTimeoutMs`, `maxRedirects` | live | per-config upstream HTTP client (cached in Rust) |
| `readTimeoutMs`, `bufferSizeKb` | live | per-stream stall timeout + read-ahead buffer size |
| `outputFormat` (`hls` \| `ts`) | live | distribution shape (`ts` = continuous MPEG-TS, external mount only) |
| `failoverEnabled` | live | walk a channel's ordered failover children on an establish failure (default **on**) |
| `failoverOnDefiniteError` | live | also treat a definitive upstream `4xx`/`5xx` as a failover trigger (default **off**) |
| `segmentCacheTtlSec` | reserved | shipped in the grant, not yet enforced |

## Public edge mode (`MASQ_EDGE`)

By default Node is the **public front door** and Rust is a **loopback-only sidecar** it relays bytes to.
Setting **`MASQ_EDGE=1`** *inverts* the topology: **Rust binds the public port** and serves streams
**in-process**, while **reverse-proxying everything else** — the SPA, `/api/*`, the token-free `.m3u` / guide
downloads, and all four WebSockets — back to Node on a loopback internal port. The public port and `DOMAIN`
are unchanged, and it's **fully reversible** by clearing the flag (no rebuild).

**Default — `MASQ_EDGE` off (Node is the front door):**

<img src="docs/diagrams/topology-default.svg" alt="Default topology with MASQ_EDGE off: Node binds the public port and relays stream bytes to the loopback-only masq-proxy sidecar.">

**`MASQ_EDGE=1` (Rust is the front door):**

<img src="docs/diagrams/topology-edge.svg" alt="Edge topology with MASQ_EDGE=1: masq-proxy binds the public port, serves the stream mounts in-process, and reverse-proxies everything else back to Node on a loopback port.">

**What changes under the hood.** In edge mode the token gate can't be Express middleware (Rust owns the
socket), so it becomes a **per-request check** against a small Rust auth cache backed by
`POST /api/internal/authorize` — revocation lands within a **30-second TTL** (vs. strictly per-request in the
default topology). The edge **synthesizes client identity server-side** (forwarded-or-peer IP, real
User-Agent, gated username) and **ignores inbound `x-masq-*`** headers, so a public client can't spoof them.
Rust's loopback `:8787` listener (`/health` + `/probe`) is unchanged, so the channel-probe scheduler keeps
working. Because Rust is now on the critical path for *all* traffic, Node restarts it **unboundedly**.

### When to turn it on (and when not to)

The core idea: **take Node's single-threaded event loop out of the video byte path.** In the default topology
every streamed byte is handled twice (Rust → Node → client); edge mode removes that hop.

- **Many concurrent or high-bitrate viewers** *(the main reason)* — once you're serving dozens of streams (or
  a few 4K ones), Node's event loop becomes the throughput ceiling and adds jitter to everything, including
  the dashboards you monitor from. Rust shovels bytes far better without starving the control plane.
- **Keep the management UI responsive under streaming load** — Node's loop stays free for the SPA, the live
  WebSockets, and logs no matter how much video is flowing.
- **Constrained hardware (Raspberry Pi / small VPS)** — halving the per-byte copies lets the same box serve
  noticeably more streams.
- **Lowest-latency, most-durable public path** — the durability engine already lives in Rust; edge mode
  applies its backpressure straight to the client socket instead of through Node's pipe.
- **When to leave it off** — a personal setup with a handful of viewers gains nothing, and the default
  (sidecar) topology is the simpler, more battle-tested path, keeps strictly per-request token revocation, and
  has a smaller blast radius (Rust is critical-path only for streaming, not everything). Edge mode is build-
  and unit-verified, but a full runtime end-to-end pass on a live stack is still pending — treat it as an
  opt-in scale / performance topology, not the default.
